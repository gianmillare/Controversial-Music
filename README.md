# Controversial-Music

As a first capstone project, Controversial Music ventures into the minds of various artists and musical titans. Living in a decade filled with contemporary perspectives and controversial ideals, one may wonder if creating a career based on controversial viewpoints can lead to more viewership and, therefore, higher profits.
